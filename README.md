My first time using CSS Grid in a project. Hope it goes well!

Reflection: 
The final result doesn't look exactly like the goal. I didn't style the fonts or headings or box shadows because I got tired. The basic grid layout, which was the main goal of the project, matches pretty well, I think. There is one exception and that's the project cards don't span both rows alotted to them because they don't have enough content and I didn't feel like troubleshooting it. I'm sure I could fix it though.
